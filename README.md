This repository serves as the source for all the data files from the the different chapters of the book 'Practicing Statistics- Kuipers and Sklar'. 
Most of the files are prefixed with 'C' and a number followed by it. This usually refers to the Chapter number the dataset belongs to. There are some files called as Variable descriptions which lists the 
detailed meaning and context of each variable used in the various datasets.
